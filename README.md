# RiotAPIRecommendationApp


my first web app!

This is my first web app intended to give champion recommendations to people based on their most played + highest winrate champions! It uses simple postgresQL, PHP, and JQuery! They are not organized/optimized yet, but will be done soon! I also made a Java version of mapreduce recommendation algorithm that uses the Hadoop framework, so check it out here! ----> https://github.com/dighjd12/HadoopRecommendationScripts

Thanks!
